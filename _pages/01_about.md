DAWN is funded primarily by [Diamond Light Source](http://www.diamond.ac.uk/) and works within the [Eclipse Science Working Group](http://science.eclipse.org/) to allow a range of facilities to make use of the product.

Commercial and non-commercial partners participate to the DAWN collaboration. **DAWN** also contributes to and uses [PyDev](http://pydev.org/).

Who we are and what we're doing:**DAWN** is an open source software ([licence](http://www.dawnsci.org/licence)) built on the Eclipse/RCP platform in order to scale to address a wide range of applications and to benefit from the workbench and advanced plugin system implemented in Eclipse. The only limiting factors are ideas and human resources. For this reason contributors are welcomed!  

DAWN is mainly developed at the Diamond Light Source ([http://www.diamond.ac.uk/](http://www.diamond.ac.uk/)).

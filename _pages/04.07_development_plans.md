and Feature Slates.

Plans are now kept @Â [http://confluence.diamond.ac.uk/display/DAWN/Project+Plans](http://confluence.diamond.ac.uk/display/DAWN/Project+Plans)

##### Old Plans

Feature slates are open brainstorming exercises. From DAWN 1.5 Vulture onwards the Diamond and ESRF committers will publish the joint development plan using a MoSCoW table linking to Jira tickets. (Note that some of these tickets will not be publicly accessible, however the features will be available in the binary and documentation of the release.)

The data analysis workbench is based on [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) RCP and is working with the [Eclipse Foundation](http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/) for open source software. Many people know Eclipse as an IDE for developing code in Java, C++ or Python (Pydev) however for some time the Eclipse Foundation has been championing a wider ecosystem of open source projects. This growing collection of work, which could be seen similar to the Apache Foundation, encompasses projects in many different languages which share the eclipse license and expertise in open source.

DAWN is proud to join the Eclipse Foundation and has helped to form [The Science Working Group](http://science.eclipse.org/) with Eclipse Foundation members whom have similar goals and interest, for instance plotting, data description, slicing, mathematics of nD arrays. We have also contributed the [DAWNSci](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dawnsci) eclipse project.

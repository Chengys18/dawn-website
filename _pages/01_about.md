#### DAWN

**DAWN** is an open source software ([licence](http://www.dawnsci.org/licence)) for the visualisation and processing of scientific data. Although specifically developed for data from synchrotron based techniques, many of the features of **DAWN** are useful in other fields. **DAWN** loads data from many common formats (text files, tiffs, hdf5...), as well as those specific to x-ray techniques (NeXus, EDF, MAR...). 

**DAWN** is funded primarily by [Diamond Light Source](http://www.diamond.ac.uk/) and works within the [Eclipse Science Working Group](http://science.eclipse.org/) to allow a range of science facilities to make use of the product.

There are several other open source projects either related to **DAWN** or that **DAWN** is built around, a non-exhaustive list of these projects can be found below:

#### OpenGDA

The [GDA project](http://www.opengda.org) is an open-source framework for creating customised data acquisition software for science facilities such as neutron and x-ray sources. It is based on the Generic Data Acquisition (GDA) software developed at Diamond Light Source. The GDA was initially developed at SRS Daresbury but since 2003 it has been adopted by Diamond Light Source who took over as the principal developer. **DAWN** shares some core file reading, processing and visualisation code with GDA.

#### Eclipse January

[Eclipse January](https://www.eclipse.org/january) is a set of libraries for handling numerical data in Java. It is inspired in part by NumPy and aims to provide similar functionality. 

#### Eclipse Nebula

**DAWN** makes extensive use of the [Eclipse Nebula](https://www.eclipse.org/nebula/) project, especially the [visualization](https://www.eclipse.org/nebula/widgets/visualization/visualization.php) components.

#### JZY3D

[Jzy3d](http://jzy3d.org) is an open source 3d plotting java library which **DAWN** uses for surface, waterfall and volume render plots.

#### PyDEV

[PyDev](http://www.pydev.org) is a Python IDE for Eclipse, which **DAWN** uses for Python and Jython developememt.

#### HDF5

**DAWN** can open [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) files and makes full use of the lazy approach to loading data that is one of the key benefits of HDF5. *DAWN* also has a very frequent releases and uses a very up-to-date version of the HDF5 library (supporting SWMR and virtual datasets), and includes a number of filters for decompression.

The DataVis perspective in **DAWN** can be used as an alternative to [HDFView](https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/), and supports viewing the HDF5 tree as well as advanced visualization of HDF5 datasets (taking slices, rendering as volumes, taking views of slices, plotting against other views...).

**DAWN** works well with multidimensional datasets, having visualisation modes specifically for 1, 2, 3 and 4 dimensions datasets, that also work for slices of high-dimension datasets.

#### NeXus

[NeXus](https://www.nexusformat.org/) is a common data format for neutron, x-ray, and muon science. It is being developed as an international standard by scientists and programmers representing major scientific facilities in order to facilitate greater cooperation in the analysis and visualization of neutron, x-ray, and muon data. NeXus is based on HDF5 but uses a standardized attribute tagging system to give coherent structure to the HDF5 tree, using the concept of [base classes](http://download.nexusformat.org/doc/html/classes/base_classes/index.html) and [application definitions](http://download.nexusformat.org/doc/html/classes/applications/index.html).

**DAWN** parses NeXus tags and supports NeXus in the following ways:

- DataVis uses the @default tag in NXentry and NXroot to determine which dataset to show as default
- Mapping finds all NXdata groups and looks at the (post-2014)axes tag structure to determine if the file contains grid scan data, as well as using the @interpretation tag to identify RGB images.
- Processing parses the @depends_on transformations of the NXmx application definition, found in the NXdetector, to determine 2-theta or q values of the pixels in 2D diffraction detectors
- Powder Calibration saves the calibration result in an NXmx compatible NXdetector.

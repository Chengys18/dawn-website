## []()Introduction

This document is designed to briefly detail new features to
which we can choose to commit in Dawn Raptor. A discussion will follow 
as which
features should be worked on in Dawn Raptor and features added to Jira 
sprints as decided later in the development cycle. The estimated 
development times
quoted are not elapsed time, just hours coding; they do not allow for 
meetings
etc. 

##### []()* Completed in Raptor

##### []()* Not planning to do

##### []()** Carried forward to future releases.

## []()Detailed Design

_**Large Changes**_

### []()Harmonizing Workflow Technology

The
 repositories on github are based on old passerelle versions as are the 
Dawn actors. Dawn should be upgraded to use the new release of 
passerelle (the build will be partly done from these new repos instead).
 Ideally a github fork will exist to allow any developer of Dawn to 
check in a fix which can have a pull request to passerelle.

**Estimate:**_unknown     _**Status: **_Refectoring_**  ****Collaborator: **_ESRF_

### []()Workflow Upgrade

The workflow tool could be upgraded to be more user
friendly. At the moment the log file is used to develop workflows and 
once they
are running, it can be hard to diagnose failure. Recent experience with 
the ARPES project has shown that some expected features are missing from
 workflow editing.

#### []()Debug or ‘Stepping Mode’ *

Ability to ‘debug’ workflow in
the UI. This would mean coupling the Passerelle debug (available with the event
director model) with the Eclipse RCP debug framework. Using the RCP debug
extensions would mean pydev and Passerelle debugging would be linked i.e. break
points would be hit in either system during the debugging of one workflow.

**Estimate: 24h  Status: Underway   ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

#### []()Dry run ability.

 This is having a more user friendly/flexible
‘mock’ system than currently available. For instance taking actors out of the
loop, they grey out. Disconnecting and reconnecting tango motors, data
collection scripts run in a test or real environment. Validation of spec scripts and GDA jython scripts.

**Estimate: 8-24h (task needs better definition)    Status: New feature   ****Collaborator: **_ESRF/Passerelle_

#### []()User friendly workflow development *

With better error handling. At
the moment when developing a workflow you have to use the log file. Instead the
user should see and actor go red and a user understandable message be shown
with an additional link to the right part of the log stack for experts. There
should be a tighter integration with eclipse parts – for instance the eclipse
error log. This is linked to debug as well in that it makes it easier and more
precise in feel when you develop a workflow.

**Estimate: 8-24h (task needs better definition)    Status: New feature   ****Collaborator: **_ESRF/Passerelle_

#### []()Traffic Light Colour Scheme

A traffic light colour
methodology applied everywhere, green running, amber stalled, red error. So
actors when selected and running would be green, user interface actors in JMX
would be amber while waiting for input, actors which fail would be red. Actions
would also be colour coded this way.

**Estimate: 6-8h                        Status: New feature      ****Collaborator: **_ESRF/Passerelle_

### []()Plotting API Upgrade *

The
 plotting API currently does not allow 3D. If it was extended to 3D the 
elegant API design which we have the benefit of for 1 and 2D plotting 
today will allow new an interesting parts to be created using a rational
 API. The prototype API also fixes a number of defects in the 
PlotView/PlotServer interaction and will simplify Dawn code greatly at 
the point where the plot server connects to the user interface.

**Estimate: 5d                        Status: New feature      ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

### []()Dawn Web Interface (DWI) Using RAP * _(Prototype made)_

The new plotting is dawn using draw2d which, with some
modifications to existing Dawn source code, is available in the RAP the web
interface. The DWI feature would allow remote log in back to the visit space using
fedid and password followed by the viewing of data collected. The RAP
application would support the project explorer for the remote file space (the
visit) and allow the editor parts used to visualise the data to run correctly
(double click and open image). This has an advantage that in order to be viewed
the data does not have to be downloaded only the current image created from it.
In later Dawn releases, DWI could be extended to support more of the
functionality of Dawn, tools and ipython for instance. A server (hardware) would
be required to support the RAP application and the feature would be supported
in a ‘Pre-release’ prototype format for Dawn 1.1.

**Estimate:  80h            Status: New feature      ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

_**Small / Medium changes**_

### []()Interactive Plot Actor *

This
 is an actor (to be used in the ARPES pipeline but it is generic) to 
simplify the workflow and make it even easier to use. It will be a popup
 form similar to the review actor which shows a plot of the incoming 
data in 1D or 2D (and 3D when the plotting API is upgraded). The data 
may be interacted with tools and the resulting ROIs and other data (such
 as fit traces and smoothing) will be forwarded in the workflow message.

**Estimate: 2d                        Status: New feature      ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

### []()Smoothing for 1D

1D
 plots can be smoothed using an algorithm already developed by DLS. The 
plotting should be extended to have UI to drive the smoothing such that 
any plot may be smoothed

**Estimate: 4h                        Status: New feature      ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

### []()Harmonizing DExplore and Data Browsing perspective

A ticket has already been created for this: http://jira.diamond.ac.uk/browse/DAWNSCI for those with access.

### []()Pydev Actor *

Similar
 to the current python actor, this will allow python scripts to be run 
in the current pydev configured interpreter. Breakpoints added with 
pydev will ideally be supported.

**Estimate: 1-3d                        Status: New feature      ****Collaborator: **_Diamond (Contractor)_

### []()New Workflow Actors

New actors available in the workflow. As follows:

#### []()Tool Action *

Ability to drive any 2D or 1D
tool, for instance azimuthal integration, box profile etc. from the workflow
using a specific actor.

**Estimate: 4-6h/tool   Status: New
Feature    ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

#### []()Improved System Command Actor(s)

Actors to complete substitution
into one or more files, run a process and then complete extraction of one or
more result files. This would allow arbitrary system processes to be run, for
instance Alun batch script jobs to be easily. The replace and extract actors
would be general purpose and come with a custom editor similar to an edna
actor.

**Estimate: 20h                         Status: New Feature    ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

#### []()R-script Actor

Ability to call R-scripts from
workflows and reuse existing mathematics in that language. Java integration
with R is claimed to be good and products like KNIME already support this
(could also support KNIME actors but these have the actor level hard coded into
Swing). 

**Estimate: 8h               Status:
New Feature     ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

#### []()Taverna Support

Ability to call taverna workflows
in a similar way to how composite actors work. If the RCP plugins for taverna
are ready when this feature is coded it may be possible to have a taverna editor
and good integration.

[http://dev.mygrid.org.uk/wiki/display/TNG/Preview+1](http://dev.mygrid.org.uk/wiki/display/TNG/Preview+1)

**Estimate: 8h               Status:
New Feature      ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

### []()Deploy Workflows as Actions in Editors and Workbench

This
 feature allows any .moml file to be reused as an action in a special 
menu on any data file. When the data file is opened the user may run the
 algorithm without having to open and run the Passerelle user file. 
There will be a few deployed by default such as background image 
subtraction, medium of flat field images, azimuthal integration, packing
 of image folders into hdf5 files etc. as available.

Creators of a
 workflow will be able to right click on the file and open a wizard to 
choose how the action should be deployed. The workflow runs without UI 
interaction as the editor provides the data. It has also been suggested 
that there be an option to automatically apply the workflow when an 
image is opened or viewed in the image viewer. This is a general feature
 and has wide applications in image and 1D data manipulation.

**Estimate: 32h   **   **Status: New feature      ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

### []()Rotation ability for selections

Add ability for regions of interest to rotate fully (for
instance rectangle). Perhaps a tool for manipulating rotation.

**Estimate:  8h  Status: 
New Feature    ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

### []()Macintosh Support (first steps)

The first part of the work required to support MacOS -
compiling CBF libraries. This will allow most of dawn features to work on Mac
as HDF5 is already working. The 3D viewer (jogl) will likely not be included in
this step. Graeme Winter has offered to compile the JNI C code on Mac.

**Estimate: 
8h  Status:  Underway    ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

### []()Toolbar Position *

The plotting toolbar is long, for instance the zoom actions
and the image tools are many. It would be good to allow coolbar docking around
plots meaning users can click and drag toolbars to the side of the plot. For
instance the image tools may automatically appear to the side of the plot
unless switched off.

**Estimate:  ~10h          Status:  New Feature    ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

### []()Open File Loading

One of the neat features of Fable was that you can write
your own loaders in python. This means any ascii or unusual image format is
supported. This feature would allow the LoaderFactory to read Eclipse extension
points for user defined loaders. This would mean Java and python loaders could
be plugged into it. The python loaders would be called using rpc, work in
cpython and conform to a given interface. The Java loaders already have a Java
interface they must implement.

**Estimate: 6h               Status:
First version in repository, not tested    ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

### []()Colour Scale for Intensity *

This feature was discussed for Dawn 1.0. There was hope that
the scale already existing in SWT XY-Graph would be available in time for Dawn
1.0. The feature is to provide a third axis apart from the positional ones
correlating colour used with intensity value.

**Estimate:  8h  Status: New feature (maybe there will be a free
version of this) ****   ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

### []()Graph Legend Move

Optionally place the graph legend on the left instead of at
the bottom. API Change to plotting.

**Estimate: 4h               Status: New Feature    ****   ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

### []()Masking Upgrade *

This idea is to allow masks to be saveable and choosable
from a list so that a user can create a mask and apply it to many images using HDF5. The
first version will allow masks to be saved to file. Later the concept of an
active mask may be introduced so that and image loaded of the correct size will
have the mask applied automatically.

In addition masking will have
 improvements for how the user interacts with the drawing of regions. A 
new method of masking will be introduced to allow single pixel tools to 
be created. The tools will require the use to zoom until no-downsampling
 is done so that individual pixels can be edited without the use of 
regions which are less precise.

http://jira.diamond.ac.uk/browse/DAWNSCI-184

            **Estimate: 6d   Status:
New Feature     ****   ****Collaborator: **_Diamond_

** **

### []()Maxima, Minima, Points of Inflection finding

There is currently a peak fitting tool which fits a function
to a peak. In fact very often required is an algorithm to mark maxima, minima
and points of inflection in 1D data (the first of these being the most useful).
This does not fit a function and actually puts an annotation on the real data
at the point of a local maximum (for instance). This work should take the form
of:

1.    
An algorithm which can be driven separately to
the UI (from one of the maths team, Peter or Mark)

2.    
A UI tool similar to the fitting tool

**Estimate: 8h UI, 8-16h algorithm                        Status:
New Feature**

### []()**P2 Update Site**

Get the auto update working properly from P2 and set up the
appropriate locations as default.

**Estimate: **5 d               ** Status:** New Feature        **Collaborator: **_Diamond_        

 

### []()**Image Stack Loading ***

Allow the loading of a stack/directory of images as a
volume, and displayed as such with the slicing tools.

**Estimate: **1d               ** Status:** New Feature        **Collaborator: **_Diamond_  

 

### []()**Integrate simple ITK into Java dataset**

Bring in this jar, and link functionality into the dataset
objects

[http://www.itk.org/Wiki/A_visual_guide_to_SimpleITK_in_Java](http://www.itk.org/Wiki/A_visual_guide_to_SimpleITK_in_Java)

**Estimate: **5d               ** Status:** New Feature        **Collaborator: **_Diamond_  

 

### []()**Integrate simple ITK into scisoftpy**

This can use the python bindings for python and the java
bindings for Jython.

**Estimate: **5d               ** Status:** New Feature        **Collaborator: **_Diamond_  

### []()Color Mapping Update *

Update colour mapping tool to deal correctly with RGB images

**Estimate: **3 days       ** Status:** Underway        **Collaborator: **_Diamond_  

 

### []()Update image plotting

Update image plotting and colour mapping to deal with
Composite datasets (for mapping experiments)

**Estimate: **5 days       ** Status:** New Feature        **Collaborator: **_Diamond_  

### []()Java7 Support *

A new Java7 based build of Dawn will be produced and tested in the course of Raptor.

**Estimate: **1 day       ** Status:** New Feature        **Collaborator: **_Diamond_
